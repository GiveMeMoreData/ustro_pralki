# UstroPralki 0.1.3  :cyclone: :zap: :cyclone:

Welcome to the home repository of the **UstroPralki** project.  
Our goal if to provide a ease to each and every hard working WUT student living in dormitory.  
Every day hundreds of student waste their essential time on checking if their public washing machine is available to use.  
We aid them in their struggle by providing an *Flutter Mobile App* that allows them to check if washing machines in their dormitory are currently fully functional and unused.
